              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Pluto is the final planet in the solar system. Pluto is an outlier in its classification because while it is small and rocky like a Terrestrial planet it is comprised mainly of frozen water and gasses and thus has a density similar to a Jovian planet. Pluto is located within the Kuiper belt, an area of rock and ice past Neptune. Pluto has 1 major moon called Charon.</p>

              <h2>Moons of Pluto</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Charon &minus; Charon is Pluto&apos;s largest moon, not much smaller than the planet itself and only slightly less dense, meaning the moon is probably made of the same materials as Pluto. One feature that was discovered with the 2015 flyby of the New Horizons space craft shows a mountain protruding out of the middle of a crater, this feature has many geologists stumped as to how it formed.</p>

              <h2>Pluto facts</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p><b>Is it a planet?</b> &minus; Since 1992, many astronomers have found similar, if not larger objects in the Kuiper Belt, this has led to discussions on whether Pluto is a planet or not. However after some debate it was reinforced that because Pluto has historically been known as a planet the International Astronomical Union have decided that for the foreseeable future Pluto is a planet.</p>

              <span></span>
              <p>Pluto has been visited by the New Horizons probe in 2015 through till 2016, after which the probe moved on to study other Kuiper Belt Objects.</p></br>
