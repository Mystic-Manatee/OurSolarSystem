              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Earth is the third planet in the solar system and is the largest of the terrestrial planets. Earth is home to humanity and thousands of other kinds of life forms. Earth is the closest planet to the Sun that has a moon.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Earth&apos;s surface is primarily made up of water, covering over 70% of the surface.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Earth has a thick atmosphere made of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), the rest is made of trace amounts of other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and water.</p>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h2>The Moon</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Earth only has 1 moon. The Moon is locked to Earth&apos;s gravitational field, these gravitational ties between the Moon and Earth are what cause tides to happen in bodies of water.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Because the mass of the Moon is far less than that of Earth the gravitational power of the Moon is less than on Earth, humans weigh only 16.5% as much as they do on Earth.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>The Moon has geologic activity. Due to the pushing and pulling between the gravitational forces of the Moon and Earth, small cracks occur under the surface of the Moon these are known as &rdquo;moonquakes&rdquo;, moonquakes were discovered during the Apollo missions.</p>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h2>Earth facts</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>The size of the Moon &minus; The Moon is roughly 1/4 the size of Earth. No other planet has a moon that large relative to the size of its host planet.</p>
              <p>A part of me &minus; The Moon was once a part of Earth. Back when the solar system was forming a large body, thought to be the size of Mars crashed into Earth, causing part of Earth to break off and begin orbiting the planet, thus the Moon was born.</p>
              <p>Ups and downs &minus; The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, which is 8.8 kilometers above sea level. The lowest point on Earth is the Challenger Deep at 10.9 kilometers below sea level.</p>
              <p>Breathe the fresh air &minus; The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are produced by plant life converting carbon dioxide into oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
              <p>It&apos;s all about me! &minus; For thousands of years ancient astronomers believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe.</p>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h2>Missions to The Moon</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>The Moon is the only object outside of Earth that has been visited by humans. The Apollo missions 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 were all successful in taking humans to the surface of the Moon. Over the course of the missions many photographs and over 400kg of samples were brought back to Earth.</p>
