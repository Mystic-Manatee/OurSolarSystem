              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Venus is the second planet in our solar system and is close in size to Earth. It has a very thick atmosphere mainly made of carbon dioxide, this thick atmosphere retains heat (greenhouse effect) even during the nights. Because of this heat retention Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system reaching an average of 462 degrees Celsius during the day.</p>

              <span></span>
              <p>Old climate &minus; It is theorised that billions of years ago the climate on Venus was quite similar to that of Earths and could have possessed large amounts of water. However, due to the increase in temperatures over time that water boiled off long ago and now the planet is too hot to sustain life.</p>

              <h2>Missions to Venus</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Due to the inhospitable environment on the surface, the Venera mission to Venus was not very successful. The robots were sent to the planet by the Soviet Russians during the 1970&apos;s and 1980&apos;s and would not last longer than 2 hours on the surface. </p>
