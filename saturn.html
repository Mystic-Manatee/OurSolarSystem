              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second Jovian planet, it is perhaps best known for its distinct ring around its equator. Perhaps one of its lesser known features is how light it is, the entire planet is less dense than water and if you were to have a bathtub large enough to fit the planet into then Saturn would float. Saturn&apos;s atmosphere is mainly composed of hydrogen (96%) and helium (4%), however there is also trace amounts of ammonia that give the planet its yellow colouration.</p>

              <h2>The ring of Saturn</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>All Jovian planets have rings, primarily made of ice particles, however Saturn&apos;s is the most pronounced and unique. Not only is Saturn&apos;s ring made of ice but also rock and dust particles, there are many theories surrounding how the ring of Saturn formed, the two most common theories involve a moon of Saturn, one theory states that it is debris from an asteroid or meteor hitting a moon while the other theory states that the moon was torn apart when it came too close to the planet and the debris was thrown out into the rings.</p>

              <h2>Moons of Saturn</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Saturn has 62 moons, ranging in size from less than 1 kilometer in diameter all the way up to the largest moon Titan which is larger than Mercury. Saturn has a set of 7 &rdquo;main moons&rdquo; which are the planet&apos;s largest.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Mimas &minus; The surface area of Mimas is roughly the size of Spain. The moon is made mainly of water ice and has a low density because of this. The moons most distinctive feature is a large crater 130 kilometers wide.</p>
              <p>Enceladus &minus; Enceladus is about 500 kilometers in diameter and made of ice and rock. This moon is home to over 100 cryovolcanoes that spew out water vapour and other minerals such as sodium chloride.</p>
              <p>Tethys &minus; Tethys has the lowest density of any moon in the solar system, this is due to it being made almost exclusively of water ice with very little amounts of rock. Tethys is home to a huge crater known as Odysseus which is 400 kilometers in diameter.</p>
              <p>Dione &minus; Dione is made of water ice and a dense silicate rock core. The moon is also home to a large ocean underneath the icy surface.</p>
              <p>Rhea &minus; Rhea is made primarily of water ice and rock, giving it a low density. Not much is known about Rhea, it was only in 2005 when the Cassini spacecraft went to Saturn that the theory of Rhea having a solid rock core was disproved through data received from the spacecraft.</p>
              <p>Titan &minus; Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system, only behind Jupiter&apos;s moon Ganymede. Titan is the only moon to have a dense atmosphere and the only object other than Earth to have evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. The moon is made primarily of water ice and rock. Titan&apos;s thick atmosphere prevented astronomers from gaining a better understanding of the moon&apos;s surface and it was only with the Cassini spacecraft&apos;s flyby of Saturn and its moons that we gained further insight into the unique properties of this moon with the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon on the surface. </p>
              <p>Iapetus &minus; Iapetus is made of water ice and rocky material, giving it a low density. The moon has quite a few unique properties, most notably are is two-tone colouration, the fact it is more walnut shaped then spherical or ellipsoid like most other moons and it has large amounts of huge craters, five of which are over 350 kilometers wide with the largest, known as Turgis being over 580 kilometers in diameter.</p>

              <h2>Saturn facts</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Shine! &minus; Saturn is the fifth brightest object in the solar system, and because of this it was one of the five planets to have been discovered with the naked eye.</p>
              <p>A bit windy &minus; Like all Jovian planets, Saturn has very strong wind currents, in fact, Saturn has the strongest wind speeds in the solar system with some gusts going as fast as 1,800 kilometers per hour.</p>
              <p>The white spot &minus; Saturn has storm spots similar to Jupiter, the most notable is named the Great White Spot after the famous storm clouds of Jupiter. </p>

              <h2>Missions to Saturn</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Saturn has been visited by 4 spacecraft, 3 finished missions and 1 ongoing.</p>
              <p>Finished missions &minus; Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.</p>
              <p>Currently active &minus; Cassini</p>
