              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is the smallest terrestrial planet in our solar system.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, because of this the planet can&apos;t regulate its temperature, this results in very extreme temperature changes between night and day. The planet can range from 430 degrees Celsius during the day down to -170 degrees Celsius at night.</p>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h2>Moons of Mercury</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Mercury has no moons, this characteristic is shared only by one other planet in the solar system â€“ Venus.</p>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h2>Mercury facts</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Not so hot! &minus; Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system, this award goes to Venus.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Thin atmosphere &minus; The atmosphere of Mercury is made of up atoms shaved off the surface of the planet by the powerful solar winds of the Sun, because of its proximity to the Sun the atoms then quickly escape into space instead of forming a proper atmosphere, this means that more and more atoms need to be taken from the surface to replenish the atmosphere.</p>
              <span></span>

              <h2>Missions to Mercury</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>There have been 2 unmanned missions to Mercury so far. The first was Mariner 10 in 1974/75 with three fly-bys to take pictures of half of the planet. Then in 2011 the MESSENGER probe was sent to take more complex measurements of the planet including the geology and nature of the planets magnetic field, once the MESSENGER probe completed its mission in 2015 it was programmed to use the last of its fuel to take it out of orbit around Mercury and crash into the planet.</p>
