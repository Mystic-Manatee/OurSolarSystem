              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is the final terrestrial planet in the solar system. Mars has a thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, causing the planet to not hold temperature well, this leads to temperatures of -130 degrees Celsius at night to 27 degrees Celsius during the day. Mars has polar ice caps made of water and carbon dioxide.</p>

              <h2>Moons of Mars</h2>

              <p>Mars has 2 moons, Phobos and Deimos. Mars is the only terrestrial planet to have more than one moon.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Phobos &minus; Phobos is the largest and closest moon to Mars and is the closest moon to its host planet in the solar system.</p>
              <p>Deimos &minus; Deimos is smaller and father away from Mars compared to Phobos.</p>

              <span></span>
              <p>Olympus Mons &minus; Olympus Mons is a shield volcano and is the tallest mountain currently known in the solar system, it sits at 21 kilometres in height and 600 kilometres in width. Recent findings of flowing lava also suggest that the volcano may still be active.</p>
              <p>Dusty! &minus; Mars experiences the largest dust storms in the solar system, these storms can cover the entire planet and last for months at a time.</p>
              <p>Curiosity &minus; While many other missions to Mars have been done, the Curiosity rover is the most current mission to the planet and is still running now. The Curiosity rover has been on Mars since 2012 and has provided huge insight into how the planet works such as taking rock samples for analysis. Curiosities largest discovery however came in 2015 when it discovered evidence of water and lakebeds in a crater.</p>
