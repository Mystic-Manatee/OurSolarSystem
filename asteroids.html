              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>There are many types of objects floating through space that are not gravitationally locked to a planet like a moon, two of these are asteroids and comets. While both asteroids and comets are astral bodies that float through space they are vastly different, here we will explore the differences.</p>

              <h3>Asteroids</h3>
              <span></span>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Asteroids are small rocky objects that orbit the Sun in an area known as the asteroid belt, this belt is located between Mars and Jupiter. This belt contains hundreds of asteroids that are larger than 100km with the largest being Ceres at roughly 900km in diameter and could possibly contain millions of asteroids 1km in diameter or less.</li>
                <li>When asteroids collide they break up into small parts that are flung out into the solar system, these are known as meteors. When some of these meteors make their way to Earth they get burned up entering the atmosphere and this burning meteor is what we know as a shooting star.</li>
              </ul>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h3>Comets</h3>
              <span></span>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Comets come from the outer regions of the solar system, they are large balls of ice, rock and dust. Most comets stay in the outer reaches of the solar system, making it impossible to view them from Earth. In the outer solar system a comet only has a solid body. When a comet is brought into the inner regions of the solar system however the heat from the sun warms the ice up and turns it into a gas, this gas then trails behind the comet, this trail of rock and gas is known as the “coma”, this coma can be over 1 million kilometers long. </li>
              </ul>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h3>In conclusion</h3>
              <span></span>
              <p>To summarise, the key differences between an asteroid and a comet are thus:</p>
              <span></span>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Asteroids are made almost entirely of rock and are small while comets are made out of ice, rock and dust and can be large.</li>
                <li>Asteroids reside in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter while comets come from the Kuiper Belt in the outer reaches of the solar system.</li>
              </ul></br>
