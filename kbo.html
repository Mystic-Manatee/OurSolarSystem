              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>The Kuiper belt is a huge band of rock, dust and frozen methane, nitrogen, ammonia and water. It is theorised that the materials in the Kuiper belt are what remains after the formation of the Jovian planets in the outer solar system and as such are a point of interest for scientists to try and grasp the state of the solar system when it was just forming. It is thought that Neptune&apos;s moon Triton and Saturn&apos;s moon Phoebe originated from the Kuiper belt.</p>
              <p>Currently, the largest object within the Kuiper belt is the dwarf planet Pluto.</p>
