              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>Jupiter sits at the fifth furthest planet from the Sun and is the first Jovian planet and is also the largest planet in the solar system. If Jupiter had been only 75 times larger than it currently is it would have become a star in its own right, giving our solar system 2 suns. Like all Jovian planets, Jupiter is a gas giant and shows very complicated wind patterns, the most recognisable of these would be the Great Red Spot.</p>

              <h2>Moons of Jupiter</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Jupiter has the largest amount of moons of any planet, sitting at 68 confirmed moons, however, most of them are small and insignificant. All of these moons were passing objects but the strong gravitational pull of Jupiter pulled the objects into orbit around the planet. There are 3 categories of moon around Jupiter.</p>
              <span></span>
              <h3>Inner moons</h3>
              <p>These are moons which orbit closest to Jupiter and are also known as the Amalthea group. The moons in this group are: Metis, Adratra, Amalthea and Thebe.</p>  
              <span></span>
              <h3>Galilean moons</h3>
              <p>The largest 4 moons of Jupiter. These are some of the largest objects in the solar system outside of planets.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Io &minus; Io is the fifth moon of Jupiter and the fourth largest in the solar system. Io is the most geologically active moon in the solar system, with over 400 volcanoes across its surface spewing sulphur as far as 300 kilometres into the air.</p>
              <p>Europa &minus; Europa is the smallest of the Galilean moons, but despite being the smallest of the bunch it is still the sixth largest in the solar system. Europa is covered entirely by ice, with scientists theorising that below the frozen surface could be a large salt water ocean, if this is proven to be true then Europa would be the best bet of finding life beyond Earth within our solar system.</p>
              <p>Ganymede &minus; Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and is larger than some planets such as Mercury and Pluto and if it were orbiting the Sun rather than Jupiter it would be classified as a planet itself. </p>
              <p>Callisto &minus; Callisto is the fourth and final Galilean moon, made of rock and ice it is 99% the size of Mercury, and like Ganymede could be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun instead of Jupiter. Callisto is made of rock, iron and ice. When viewed through a telescope, Callisto is brighter than the Moon, since it is made of ice and ice reflects the Sun brighter than the rock of the Moon.</p>
              <span></span>
              <h3>Outer moons</h3>
              <span></span>
              <p>These moons a furthest from Jupiter and are substantially smaller objects. Most of these moons are captured asteroids pulled in by the gravitational forces of Jupiter.</p>

              <h2>Jupiter facts</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>Shine &minus; Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in our solar system.</p>
              <p>Big Red &minus; The Great Red Spot is a storm that has been raging on Jupiter for over 300 years. It is so large that it was seen by ancient astronomers through telescopes. The storm is over 25,000 kilometres long, this is big enough to hold two Earths.</p>
              <p>Almost a Sun &minus; As stated before, Jupiter could be a Sun if it was slightly larger. But it is not only its size that could have caused it to be a star, the gas giant is made of 90% hydrogen and 10% helium â€“ almost the exact same gas composition as the Sun.</p>

              <h2>Missions to Jupiter</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>9 spacecraft have visited Jupiter so far, they are Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, Ulysses, New Horizons and Juno.</p>
