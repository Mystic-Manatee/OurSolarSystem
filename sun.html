              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>The sun is the only star in our solar system. It is a main sequence star which means it performs nuclear fusion on hydrogen to produce helium, this fusion creates the light that we can see from Earth. </p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Our Sun is a medium sized star. It is not as big as red giant stars found in other solar systems and it isn&apos;t as small as red dwarves either. The Sun accounts for 99.8 &percnt; of all mass in our solar system, this large mass is what causes all other objects in the solar system to orbit around the Sun through gravitational forces.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>The Sun is approximately 1.4 million kilometers in diameter, and could fit almost 1 million Earth&apos;s inside.</p>
              <span></span>
              <h2>The life cycle of the sun</h2>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h3>Red Giant</h3>
              <span></span>
              <p>It is theorised that the Sun will go through 2 different phase changes during the rest of its life cycle. In 130 million years, when the Sun finally depletes its reserves of hydrogen it will begin fusion on the helium it has created, during this time the Sun will expand and may end up being so large that it engulfs Mercury, Venus and even Earth, at this phase the Sun will then be known as a red giant.</p>
              <span></span>
              <h3>White Dwarf</h3>
              <span></span>
              <p>Once the Sun has depleted its helium reserves it will shrink down to have a volume similar to Earth. This phase is known as a white dwarf.</p>
              <span></span>
              <span></span>
              <h2>Sun facts</h2>
              <span></span>
              <p>The Sun is almost a perfect sphere &minus; The difference between the diameter on the poles (north to south) and the equator (east to west) is only 10 kilometers and is probably the closest thing we can observe in nature that is a perfect sphere. If you were to scale the sun down to the size of a beach ball, the difference in diameter would not even be a human hairs width.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>The speed of light &minus; The Earth is roughly 150 million kilometers away from the Sun. Light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second. Dividing the distance of the Sun to the Earth (150 million) by the speed of light (300,000) gives us 500, that means that it takes 500 seconds or 8 minutes 20 seconds for light to go from the Sun to Earth.</p>
              <span></span>
              <p>Hot! Hot! Hot! &minus; At the surface, the Sun is around 5500 degrees Celsius, however, temperatures within the sun can get as high as 15 million degrees Celsius!</p>
